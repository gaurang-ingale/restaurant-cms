# Restaurant CMS Strapi app

## Description:

CMS for the restaurant-frontend project repository (Restaurant Template)

## Technologies used:

Strapi CMS

## Detailed description:

- A CMS allows non-developer users and creators to add, edit and remove content easily from the web-app in production.
- Having a CMS instead of hard-coding content into the web-app allows for quicker and lesser maintainance.
- Pairing a headless CMS such as Strapi with a reactive frontend such as NextJS or with any other SPA framework for that matter, offers significantly better performance as well as a significantly better user experience rather than some CMS such as Wordpress.
